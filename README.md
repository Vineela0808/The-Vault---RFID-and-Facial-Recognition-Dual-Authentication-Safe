# The-Vault---RFID-and-Facial-Recognition-Dual-Authentication-Safe
## Abstract
The Vault is a smart safe system integrating a dual-layered authentication mechanism that combines RFID verification and facial recognition to maximize security. Designed for high-security applications, the system ensures that only authorized users can access the contents of the safe. The process begins with RFID-based identification followed by facial verification using a camera and Raspberry Pi. A custom 3D-printed safe, secured with a servo-based locking mechanism, completes the hardware interface. With visual and auditory feedback at every step, this project offers a modern, efficient, and intuitive approach to securing physical assets.
## System Overview
The user initiates authentication by tapping their RFID card on a reader. The Arduino Uno verifies the tag using SPI communication with the RC522 module. If the RFID is valid, the Raspberry Pi triggers a camera to capture the userâ€™s face. Facial recognition is performed and the result is sent back to the Arduino via UART over USB Serial (CDC ACM). If both steps succeed, the Arduino unlocks the safe using a servo motor and logs the access event with audio-visual feedback.
